	<!--´	<h5> Explore the lives of a Quaker family during the industrial age </h5>-->
	<h5> The Cope Evans Family </h5>
	<p> The Cope and Evans families were two prominent Quaker families in
	  Philadelphia. They were influential in their roles as merchants and
	  businessmen, philanthropists, and educators. Through their letters
	  and other documents we can learn a great deal about how the Copes and
	  Evanses lived through and thought about the political, economic, and
	  cultural changes of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
	<p>
	<p> Refer to the <a href = "/familytree/">Cope Evans Family Tree</a>
	  to learn more about individual members of the Cope and Evans families,
	  and to see connections between family members.</p>

	<h5> The Collection </h5>
	<p><a href = "http://triptych.brynmawr.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/cope">The Cope Evans Family Papers</a>,
	  1683-2012 consists of 5008 digitized items including letters, certificates,
	  photographs, friendship books, and account books as of June 2019. The physical collection spans
	  7.5 linear feet (18 boxes). The <a href="http://archives.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/repositories/5/resources/723#!#add_desc">
	collection guide</a> is a great resource for tracking down a particular item.</p>

	<p>Letters by Mary Drinker Cope (1766-1825) to her children are full of
	  affection as well as practical and spiritual advice. Thomas Pim Cope's
	  letters include those to his sons on his business interests. The letters
	  of Anna S. Cope (1822-1916) and Francis R. Cope (1821-1909) discuss home
	  life and children, family and friends activities; many of Anna S. Cope's
	  letters were written from family vacation spots in New England, where she
	  often went to escape the hot summer months in Philadelphia. Letters of
	  Francis R. Cope include letters written while in Virginia on Freedmen's
	  Relief Association business after the Civil War (1861-1865) as well as
	  letters related to estate sales in Washington D.C.</p>
	<p>The letters of sisters Clementine, Carolina, and Annette Cope include
	  many travel letters from Europe. Clementine Cope's letters also include
	  those written while teaching at a Freedmen's Association School in
	  Baltimore in 1865. There are a number of letters written by children;
	  of particular interest are those written by brothers Henry, Francis, and
	  William D. Cope while at Westtown Bording School in the early 1800s and
	  letters of brothers Francis R. Cope (1812-1909) and Thomas P. Cope
	  (1823-1900) while at Haverford College in the 1830s. Topics within the
	  letters include business, Haverford College and education, national events
	  such as the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the assassinations of
	  Presidents Lincoln and McKinley. A portion of the Cope Evans Family
	  Papers have been digitized and are
	         <a href="http://triptych.brynmawr.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/cope">available online</a>.</p>
	<h5> The Cope Evans Project: The inception of this site</h5>
<p> <b>The Cope Evans Project</b> is a project by Haverford College Digital
  Scholarship which explores the items in the <b>Cope Evans Family Papers Collection
    (1683-2012)</b> curated by Haverford Special Collections. The papers include
    letters, financial documents, diaries, and shipping information. This project
    engages with the collection through prose and data visualization.</p>
    <p> In the summer of 2014, three Haverford College students, Cormac Quinn Rada
      '17, Brandon Smith '16, and Andrew Kafker '17, conducted archival
      research in the Cope Evans Family Papers for their digital project titled
      “The Cope Evans Project: A History of Quaker Networks During the Industrial
      Age.” Exploring the argument and themes of Philip S. Benjamin’s influential
      work The Philadelphia Quakers in the Industrial Age, 1865-1920 (1978),
       the students documented the numerous social, cultural, economic, and
       political changes that the Cope family, a prominent Quaker family in
       Philadelphia, faced during a period of rapid industrialization and
       urbanization in America.</p>

    <p> During Summer 2019, this site was created for the project by Aleena Maryam
      '21. Old student
      visualizations and essays were moved here. A new letters map was created
      and an essay about J. Morris Evans, the sole contributor to the collection,
      was added.</p>
