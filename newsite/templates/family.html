	  <p>The Cope Evans Family Papers, 1732-1911 consists of approximately 2,900 items including letters, certificates, photographs, friendship books, and account books.</p>

	  <p>Letters by Mary Drinker Cope (1766-1825) to her children are full of affection as well as practical and spiritual advice. Thomas Pim Cope's letters include those to his sons on his business interests. The letters of Anna S. Cope (1822-1916) and Francis R. Cope (1821-1909) discuss home life and children, family and friends activities; many of Anna S. Cope's letters were written from family vacation spots in New England, where she often went to escape the hot summer months in Philadelphia. Letters of Francis R. Cope include letters written while in Virginia on Freedmen's Relief Association business after the Civil War (1861-1865) as well as letters related to estate sales in Washington D.C.</p>
	  <p>The letters of sisters Clementine, Carolina, and Annette Cope include many travel letters from Europe. Clementine Cope's letters also include those written while teaching at a Freedmen's Association School in Baltimore in 1865. There are a number of letters written by children; of particular interest are those written by brothers Henry, Francis, and William D. Cope while at Westtown Bording School in the early 1800s and letters of brothers Francis R. Cope (1812-1909) and Thomas P. Cope (1823-1900) while at Haverford College in the 1830s. Topics within the letters include business, Haverford College and education, national events such as the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln and McKinley. A portion of the Cope Evans Family Papers have been digitized and are <a href="http://triptych.brynmawr.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/cope">available online</a>.</p>

	  <p> <b>Thomas Pim Cope</b> (1768-1854), was a prominent Quaker merchant who was actively involved in the economic and social development of Philadelphia. He was born in 1768 to Caleb and Mary Cope in Lancaster, PA. Thomas P. Cope married Mary Drinker in 1792 and they had seven children: Henry (1793-1865), Francis (1794-1816), Caroline (died in infancy), William (1798-1873), Caroline R. (1802-1873), Alfred (1806-1875), and Eleanor (1807-1847) (refer to the Cope Family Tree) (Evans, 144; G. Cope, 51).</p>
	  <!--- insert image of tpc--->
	  <p>In late 1785 or early 1786, he arrived in Philadelphia from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania "to commence the acquisition of practical mercantile knowledge" (Chandler, 358). During his life, he served as a member of the Philadelphia City Council, Pennsylvania Legislature, and President of the Mercantile Library Company. Cope found financial success in his import-export business. His line of packet ships expanded networks between Philadelphia and Liverpool, England. Cope also provided financial support for one of the city’s major projects, the Pennsylvania Railroad. Cope identified as an Orthodox Quaker (Baltzell, 501, 440-441, Barbour and Frost, 187).</p>

	  <p> <b>Francis Reeve Cope</b> (1821-1909), the grandson of Thomas Pim Cope, was a merchant and businessman. In 1847, he married Anna Stewardson Brown and they had nine children: Elizabeth (1848-1937), Rachel (1850-1939), Thomas (1852-1944), William (1854-1860), Alfred (1857-1897), Francis (1859-1909), Algernon (1860-1862), Anna (1862-?), Caroline (1865-1953) (refer to the Cope Family Tree) (Evans, 144). He was involved with the Pennsylvania Freedmen’s Relief Association, a philanthropic effort established around 1862 to provide education for freed slaves (Benjamin, 76, 140-141, 128).</p>

	  <p><b>Jonathan Evans</b> (1843-1911) was the fifth child of Thomas Evans and Katharine [Catharine] Wistar. He married Rachel Reeve Cope (1850-1939), daughter of Francis Reeve Cope, in 1873. They had five children: Anna (1875-1967), Francis (1878-1946), Edward (1882-1976), Ernest (1884-1911), and Harold (1886-1977) (refer to the Cope Family Tree). All four sons graduated from Haverford College (Evans, 22, 138, 143).</p>
	  <p>For nearly thirty years, Evans served on the School Committee at Haverford College. According to his colleagues “his influence stood for conservatism in retaining the best features that differentiate our Friends’ Schools from others; that at the same time he was always ready to adopt plans in accordance with progressive standards in education” (Minutes of School Committee, Reporting Jonathan Evans' Death, 1911; Evans, 138).</p>
	  <p><b>Clementine Cope</b> (1835-1899) was the oldest child of William D. Cope (1798-1873) and Susan Newbold. She had two brothers, Edgar and Alexis, and had a close relationship with her sisters, Caroline and Annette. Her sister Eleanor died as an infant (refer to the Cope Family Tree). Clementine never married (Evans, 144; G. Cope, 112-113).</p>
