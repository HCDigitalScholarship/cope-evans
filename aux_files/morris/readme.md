### morris data

contains the scripts used to query the contentdm server for the word frequency data in letters that are returned for the query 'j. morris evans' and the resulting data.

These scripts were used to create a chart of the frequency of subject tags, but the chart was scrapped because the query returned items not actually created by j. morris evans which was the original purpose of the chart.
