  <p><b> J. Morris “Morrie” Evans (1921-2017) </b>
    was a member of Haverford College’s class of 1943.
    He donated the entirety of the Cope Evans Family Papers to Haverford
    College Special Collections. The collection is comprised
    primarily of letters but also includes diaries and financial documents.
    Evans last donated a batch of documents which was approved
    in June 2019. This addition includes letters received and sent by Evans
    himself, shipping and financial documents, and letters from
    the nineteenth century. The shipping documents illuminate
    some of the Cope Evans business patterns. 5008 items from the collection
    are available <a href=
    "http://triptych.brynmawr.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/cope">digitally</a>.
    The digitization and cataloging process was funded
     by the J. Morris and Anna T. Evans Fund.
  </p>


  <p>Evans was a conscientious objector during World War II. He worked on farms
    as alternative service. After the war, he began work as an accountant at the
    Philadelphia Quartz company which later became the PQ corporation. J. Morris
    Evans was subsequently Vice-President and Treasurer of the Corporation.</p>

    <p>In his free time, Evans compiled documents concerning the Cope Evans and kept
      track of the documents he created including family photographs and letters.
      He compiled and examined more than 5008
      documents (letters, records and diaries)
      spanning 1683 to 2012. Which is everything that is found in the collection.
       He wrote a biography of Thomas
    Pym Cope around 2002 which he distributed amongst family.
    The biography and J. Morris
  Evans' notes are available in the <a href=
  "http://archives.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/repositories/5/archival_objects/65759">
	physical collection</a>. In this <a href="http://triptych.brynmawr.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/cope/id/22466/rec/1">
	letter</a>, Evans briefly discusses the book with relatives who expressed interest in it.</p>

  <p>Among his donations, are papers he collected throughout his life. These items go as
  far back as 1930, when Evans would have been 8 or 9 years of age.
  In this <a href="http://triptych.brynmawr.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/cope/id/18524/rec/4">
    letter</a> he wishes his grandmother happy birthday and tells her about a boy
  named Francis capsizing in a pond. This shows the extent to which Evans archived
during his life.</p>
