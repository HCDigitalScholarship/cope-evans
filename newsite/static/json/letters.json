Connaught contains the present-day counties of Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon, Galway, and Leitrim. Connaught, located on the midwestern coast of the island, relied heavily on agriculture for its business, and the Famine of the mid-nineteenth century especially affected this area.\n\n<br><br>\n\nNewcastle is located in County Down, which is part of present-day Northern Ireland. Newcastle remains a seaside resort town known for its scenery. The town lies at the foot of Slieve Donard, Northern Ireland\u2f2fa>??s highest point, and its beaches and golf courses attract thousands of summer vistors.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThe Belfast Ladies Relief Association for Connaught was an interdenominational group dedicated to providing for those left hungry and destitute by the potato famine in 1845. The Association was begun on January 1, 1847, by Rev. John Edgar, whose prior public work dealt with temperance issues. Its primary focus was raising money, although many of its members did involve themselves more personally in relief work. Their primary methods of funding involved door-to-door canvassing and the operation of a Bazaar of Ladies\u2f2fa>?? Work in Belfast. Circulars with statistics and stories of the devastation were published to aid the ladies in their appeal.\n\n<br><br>\n\nAlthough food and clothing were at first the items most sought, the women had loftier goals: \"to \u2f2fa>??improve, by industry, the temporal condition of the poor females of Connaught and their spiritual [condition] by the truth of the bible.\u2f2fa>??\" (from Luddy 22) Schools teaching needlework and knitting were established throughout Connaught.
