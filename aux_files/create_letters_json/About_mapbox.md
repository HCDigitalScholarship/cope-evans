## Details about mapbox for reference

coordinates are stored as [longitude,latitude]

Extrapolate [this](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/updating-choropleth/) if you want to add a legend to your map. There's another chloropleth map that shows this online, but I found it more difficult to adapt for my purposes.
